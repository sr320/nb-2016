#Since you've been gone

Soon after Ensenada I went to Chili, SICB, and PAG (in that order).  The new year is often of time to let go of lingering projects, and likely I will be doing that soon. But to bring a few pending efforts to the forefront, so that I can analyze etc here is a bit of data that is (or soon will) be coming in.
Much of this is centered around the _Ostrea lurida_.
